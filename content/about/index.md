Hello there, I'm Jade! 

I was born in China, but raised in the Netherlands. As such, I would like to call myself a real "Dutchie". During my studies at the University of Amsterdam, I discovered my passion for human-machine and human-AI communication. What fascinates me most about emerging technologies is how they open up new ways for people to connect and communicate, enabling opportunities that we couldnâ€™t imagine before. Being a bit of a nerd, I naturally love exploring new tech, gadgets, and all things innovative.

If you'd like to talk with me about these technological developments, or perhaps even my interests or hobbies, feel free to reach out!
